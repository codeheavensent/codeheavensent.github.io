      <p>Welcome to <strong>Harpe Gaming</strong>. We have a simple
         philosophy. It has three main points:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Unplug</li>
         <li>Interact</li>
         <li>Reconnect</li>
      </ul>
      <p>And that's it. We believe that the best games are the ones that
         bring people together through shared experiences. With all
         due respect to our video gamer friends, you can't always get that from
         a computer screen. Sometimes you need the intimate approach of sitting
         face-to-face around a common table with the soda and chips at your
         elbow.</p>
      <p>We are a local board and card game store located in the heart of 
         Morgantown near the campus. We carry hundreds of games and puzzles, 
         including educational games, family games, card games, historical simulations, 
         role-playing games, and so much more. If you remember a great game from
         your youth, we probably have it in our antiques collection. If we don't,
         we know where we can get it.</p>
      <p>We're more than just a place to buy games. We celebrate gaming and
         the company of good friends. Our game room is free for all to us. Sit down,
         pick out a game from our demo library and start playing. We sponsor tournaments,
         challenges, and special social events. You'll always find a game.</p>
      <p>We're always on the lookout for the best new games. We publish periodic
         reviews of new titles. Check out the review of <a href="hg_towers.html">Towers
         and Temples</a>, new this month at Harpe Gaming.</p>
